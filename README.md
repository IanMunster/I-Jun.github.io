## Testing Enviroment with Python:
  Running a simple local HTTP server

  To get around the problem of async requests, we need to test such examples by running them through a local web server. 
  One of the easiest ways to do this for our purposes is to use Python's http.server module.

  > Note: Older versions of Python (up to version 2.7) provided a similar module named SimpleHTTPServer. 
  If you are using Python 2.x, you can follow this guide by replacing all uses of `http.server` with `SimpleHTTPServer`. 
  However, we recommend you use the latest version of Python.

### To do this:

  - Install Python. If you are using Linux or macOS, it should be available on your system already. 
  - If you are a Windows user, you can get an installer from the Python homepage and follow the instructions to install it:
  - Go to [python.org](https//:python.org)
  - Under the Download section, click the link for Python "3.xxx".
  - At the bottom of the page, click the Windows Installer link to download the installer file.
  - When it has downloaded, run it.
  - On the first installer page, make sure you check the "Add Python 3.xxx to PATH" checkbox.
  - Click Install, then click Close when the installation has finished.
  - Open your command prompt (Windows) / terminal (macOS/ Linux). To check if Python is installed, enter the following command:
```
python -V
# If the above fails, try:
python3 -V
# Or, if the "py" command is available, try:
py -V
```
This should return a version number. 
If this is OK, navigate to the directory that your example is inside, using the cd command.
```
# include the directory name to enter it, for example
cd Desktop
# use two dots to jump up one directory level if you need to
cd ..
```
Enter the command to start up the server in that directory:
```
# If Python version returned above is 3.X
# On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server"
python3 -m http.server
# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
 For me `py -3 -m http.server` works
 By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000.
 You can go to this server by going to the URL localhost:8000 in your web browser. 
 Here you'll see the contents of the directory listed â€” click the HTML file you want to run.

 > Note: If you already have something running on port 8000, 
 you can choose another port by running the server command followed by an alternative port number, e.g.
 `python3 -m http.server 7800` (Python 3.x) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7800` (Python 2.x). You can then access your content at `localhost:7800`.
